          <h2>Coding Summary</h2>
        </em>

        <p>
          When we talk about coding, we’re talking about how people communicate
          with computers. Coding, also referred to as computer programming, is
          the way that software developers tell a computer what they would like
          it to do. When writing code, developers give a set of instructions to
          a computer, and those instructions are called “code.” This means that
          coding is just the art of writing lines of code. Being able to clearly
          communicate with a computer is an incredibly valuable skill to have,
          since code itself is used in nearly all global communication devices.
          Without coding, the many new ways that we talk to each other simply
          wouldn’t exist — it’s that important! Just like every letter and
          number matters when you are writing an email to someone else, every
          letter or number that a developer uses while writing their lines of
          code will affect the way that the computer interprets those
          instructions. Coders, also known as web developers, software
          engineers, programmers, and more, use their coding skills to create a
          wide variety of technologies like websites, apps, operating systems,
          video games, robotics, and nearly anything else that can be imagined.
          All of those ideas come from code, which is easy to learn, starting
          with understanding how it works
        </p>

        <em>
          <h2>What is a Programming Language?</h2>
        </em>
        <p>
          While computers may run on binary, programming or coding languages are
          what coders use to translate the 1s and 0s into messaging humans can
          understand. Once rendered, the information is written into a set of
          instructions for machines to perform. It’s a symbiotic relationship
          that bridges the gap between human and machine. So, instead of having
          to decipher coding instructions that are written in long sequences of
          0s and 1s, imagine being able to write those same instructions using
          words that both you and the computer understand. That’s exactly what a
          programming language is. Coders no longer need to remember that
          00100010 01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00101100
          00100000 01110111 01101111 01110010 01101100 01100100 00100001
          00100010 is the set of instructions needed to write the phrase,
          “hello, world!”. Instead, they can just type those words and they
          appear. Be sure to thank the countless coders who came before us for
          developing coding languages to make our lives easier. When you’re
          first setting out on your road to becoming a coding superstar, you’ll
          be presented with myriad optional coding languages to learn. And there
          are … a lot of them. First, let’s think of this in terms of cooking.
          In this scenario, you (the programmer) are passing an original recipe
          (the code) onto a relative. If you wanted to, you could figure out how
          to send that recipe to your relative with Morse code (the binary), but
          why not make your life easier and write out the instructions one
          sentence at a time (the lines of code). Once your relative (the
          computer) has the recipe, they must follow the set of instructions you
          provided to create the final dish. The more complex the recipe, the
          more complex the dinner. Programming languages are what bridges the
          gap between computers and humans. For every app and website you’ve
          ever visited, there are dozens of programmers out there who have
          written the code to get a computer to create it for you. Just like
          there are hundreds of different spoken languages in the world, there
          are hundreds of different programming languages that programmers have
          developed over time. Here is a list of some of the most widely used
          programming languages today.

          <h2>Learning the Levels</h2>
        </em>
        <p>
          All programming languages fall into two classifications: high-level
          and low-level.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src=" https://smsh-862737-juc1ugur1qwqqqo4.stackpathdns.com/2569356/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/21MAAC037-2022-Blogs-Low-Level-vs-High-Level-Programming-Languages-660x330.png?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1"

          />
          w
        </p>
        <p>
          High-level programming languages like the ones listed above fall more
          in line with human speech. You’ll find high-level languages using
          everyday action keywords like order, run, request, etc. The biggest
          benefit of high-level languages is that they are easier for coders to
          read and write, but the biggest downside is that they take slightly
          longer for the computer to interpret.
        </p>
        <p>
          Low-level programming languages like machine code or assembly language
          are easy for a computer to understand, but nearly unrecognizable as a
          human language. This means that these languages are more difficult for
          people to code, but they perform much faster than high-level
          languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Programming languages are diverse and used in a multitude of ways. You
          don’t have to know every single language in order to become a
          developer — all it takes is one. As you become more familiar with
          them, the process of learning a new language gets easier every time.

          <h2>So, Why Learn Coding?</h2>
        </em>
        <p>
          We live in the golden age of technology. And it’s no secret that
          technology plays an integral role in a mammoth amount of industries
          around the world. From children to older adults, writing code is a
          skill that’s easy to learn — and learn to do well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some of the reasons that make writing code a beneficial and
          exciting skill to learn:
        </p>
        <em>
          <h3>Ever-growing job market</h3>
        </em>
        <p>
          Software development jobs arerising in number with no sign of slowing
          down. With opportunities abound, people looking for a career change or
          just looking to move up in a company have the chance to capitalize on
          new ventures. The job market for coding aficionados expands every day.
        </p>
        <em>
          <h3>Become better at problem-solving</h3>
        </em>
        <p>
          The essence of coding is problem-solving. Coding is essentially a
          process of examining a bigger picture and breaking it down into small,
          digestible pieces (like a chef would do) until it&#8217;s a single
          solvable task. Learning programming imparts a new perspective on how
          to approach situations — tech-related or not.
        </p>
        <em>
          <h3>Merge technical skills with creativity</h3>
        </em>
        <p>
          On the surface, people may view coding as just a bunch of letters and
          numbers mashed together to make a website. They couldn’t be more
          wrong. Coding allows you to bring your creative side and technical
          skills together and create something truly unique. In the life of a
          computer programmer, no two days are the same.
        </p>
        <em>
          <h3>Do it for fun</h3>
        </em>
        <p>
          Coding doesn’t have to be any more than a hobby. Plenty of people use
          coding as a fun way to flex their technical skills on their own time.
          You can start your blog talking about ocean kayaking, develop a site
          to post your photos of your pets, or build your own video game. With
          coding, the fun doesn’t have to end.
        </p>
        <em>
          <h3>Become self-employed</h3>
        </em>
        <p>
          The concept of being your boss is appealing to many. Learning to code
          can turn a hobby into a side hustle, and ultimately, into your own
          business. You’re free to build an e-commerce site where you can sell
          your pottery, create a hometown news site, offer Coding Classes, or
          start your web design agency. Your hours (and rate) are for you to
          decide.
